# BIKEBALANCE

# Problem: 
Bike stations on locations where many people like to use a bike to get there and often take some other form of transportaion back requires service men driving around the city to try to balance the bike stations all around Helsink. What we thought about this was if there was a way for us to predict how bikes move around Helsinki and therefore create someway for servicemen to eficently see what stations are going to be empty and full, while also for the everyday person to be able to help via an app with "quests" and rewards to move around bikes saving in on usage of trains,busses,metro and also make the job for the servicemen easier.

# World Impact:
With this application we can predict how station load thru the day and try to encurage the everyday person to use the bike more and save some on the climate! This application provided with a special "Maintenence-UI" will make the everyday work for service men around Helsinki easier by predicting when they are needed and where while also trying to offload some work on the quests that exists.

# Tech
With Ms Azure we have been able to train probability models that can calculate thru the day on how bike traffic is looking and with taht data our backend running on Azure is able to send the quests to our users to stop station overflowing and service men to intervine on predicted caos overflow much much faster

# Future Plans
This application could easily have the impact to encurage many users around Helsink to start biking more often and with the system of diffrent awards avaiable we can encurage users to go around and enjoy Helsink with tickets to muesums, are galleries, promotional campains by companies located in Helsink and more.
